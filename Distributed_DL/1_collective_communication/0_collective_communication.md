## Why `torch.distributed`?

Ray is excellent for orchestration and general distributed Python workloads, but deep learning training has a narrower requirement: workers must exchange tensors quickly and predictably.

`torch.distributed` exists for that job:

- it is built around training-oriented communication patterns
- it makes data movement and synchronization explicit
- it is the communication layer underneath tools like DDP

In this unit we use the CPU-friendly `gloo` backend.
Later GPU sections reuse the same mental model with faster GPU-oriented communication backends.

## Essential glossary

- **job**: the full distributed training run
- **node**: one machine participating in the job
- **process**: one Python worker started by the operating system
- **rank**: the global ID of one process in the job
- **local rank**: the process ID relative to one node
- **world_size**: the total number of processes in the job
- **world group**: the default process group containing every rank

**Key idea:** there is no shared memory across processes.
Each process owns its own tensors, so any data movement between ranks must be explicit.

### Minimal example

After running:

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 training_job.py
```
`torchrun` launches four processes on one node and assigns ranks `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3`.

```text
training_job
|
+-- node A
    +-- process / rank 0
    +-- process / rank 1
    +-- process / rank 2
    +-- process / rank 3
```

Here:

- the job has `world_size = 4`
- the world group is `{0, 1, 2, 3}`
- rank `0` often handles extra coordination or logging by convention, but every rank still runs user code

Later, the same idea extends to multiple nodes: each node contributes more ranks, and `world_size` is still the total across the full job.

## Hello ranks

Run:

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 1_collective_communication/1_hello_ranks.py
```

Expected result:

- four worker processes start
- every process prints the same `world_size`
- every process prints a different `rank`
- every process prints its own local tensor

What to notice:

- we launched one Python file
- `torchrun` launched four workers
- each worker ran the same code with different process-local state
- `LOCAL_RANK` and `rank` are related, but they are not always the same in multi-node jobs

Training loop connection:
One training script becomes one copy per rank; the code is shared, but each rank has its own local state and data.

---

## Point-to-point with `send` and `recv`

Before collectives, it helps to see the most direct communication pattern.

Run:

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=2 1_collective_communication/2_send_recv_demo.py
```

Expected result:

- rank `0` sends a tensor with value `1.0`
- rank `1` receives that tensor

What to notice:

- one `send` matches one `recv`
- both sides block by default until the transfer is complete
- if ranks disagree on the order or count of sends and receives, they can hang

Training loop connection:
Point-to-point communication exists, but ordinary training loops lean on collectives.

## Collective communication cheat sheet

| Operation | What it does | Common use in a training loop |
|---|---|---|
| `broadcast` | one rank sends the same tensor to everyone | rank `0` loads a checkpoint and broadcasts the model weights to every worker |
| `reduce` | combine tensors onto one destination rank | every rank sends its validation loss to rank `0`, and only rank `0` logs the total |
| `all_reduce` | combine tensors and give the result to everyone | after `loss.backward()`, gradients are summed or averaged so every rank applies the same optimizer step |
| `gather` | collect tensors onto one destination rank | each rank sends one loss or accuracy value to rank `0` for printing |
| `all_gather` | collect tensors onto every rank | in contrastive training, each rank gathers embeddings from every worker so the loss can use the full global batch |
| `scatter` | one rank sends one piece to each rank | rank `0` splits one big batch into per-rank shards and sends one shard to each worker |
| `barrier` | wait until everyone reaches the same point | all ranks wait for rank `0` to finish saving a checkpoint before the next phase starts |

What to notice:

- `broadcast`, `reduce`, `gather`, and `scatter` are root-heavy: one rank has a special source or destination role
- `all_reduce`, `all_gather`, and `barrier` are more symmetric across ranks
- by default, these operations block at the call site; async variants exist and we preview them at the end

See the diagrams in the [PyTorch tutorial](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dist_tuto.html#collective-communication).

## Broadcast

Run:

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 1_collective_communication/3_broadcast_demo.py
```

Expected result:

- rank `0` starts with `[42]`
- the other ranks start with `[-1]`
- after the broadcast, all ranks hold `[42]`

What to notice:

- rank `0` is the source of truth for this operation
- the receiving ranks must already have a compatible destination tensor
- after the call returns, every rank holds the same value

Training loop connection:
Use broadcast for sharing state from one rank to the rest of the job.

---

## Reduce vs `all_reduce`

Run:

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 1_collective_communication/4_reduce_all_reduce_demo.py
```

Expected result:

- for `reduce`, only rank `0` is guaranteed to finish with `[10]`
- on the other ranks, the local tensor may contain backend-specific intermediate results, but those values are unspecified
- for `all_reduce`, every rank finishes with `[10]`

What to notice:

- `reduce` is root-heavy: one rank owns the final answer
- `all_reduce` is symmetric: every rank receives the same final answer

Training loop connection:
Use `reduce` when only rank `0` needs a final scalar; use `all_reduce` for synching gradients before the next optimizer step.

---

## Gather vs `all_gather`

Run:

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 1_collective_communication/5_gather_all_gather_demo.py
```

Expected result:

- for `gather`, rank `0` receives `[[0], [1], [2], [3]]`
- for `all_gather`, every rank receives `[[0], [1], [2], [3]]`

What to notice:

- `gather` is root-heavy: only the destination rank allocates the full output
- `all_gather` is symmetric: every rank allocates and receives the full output


Training loop connection:
Use `gather` for rank-0-only reporting and `all_gather` when every worker needs the global view before continuing.

---

## Scatter

Run:

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 1_collective_communication/6_scatter_demo.py
```

Expected result:

- rank `0` receives `[10]`
- rank `1` receives `[20]`
- rank `2` receives `[30]`
- rank `3` receives `[40]`

What to notice:

- rank `0` prepares one input tensor per worker
- each rank blocks in the same `scatter` call
- `scatter` is the opposite of `gather`

Training loop connection:
Scatter is a simple model for handing out one per-rank shard of work from a central source.

---

## Barrier

Run:

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 1_collective_communication/7_barrier_demo.py
```

Expected result:

- in phase 1, rank `0` sleeps before entering `barrier()`
- the other ranks reach `barrier()` first and wait there
- once rank `0` enters, everyone is released
- in phase 2, rank `0` sleeps before a `broadcast`, and the other ranks wait inside `broadcast` instead
- the script then runs one final `barrier()` after the broadcast; that wait should be small because the broadcast already aligned the ranks

What to notice:

- `barrier` does not move useful model data; it synchronizes control flow
- if the previous or next line is already a blocking collective such as `broadcast`, an extra `barrier` is often redundant
- `barrier` is most useful around non-collective work such as checkpoint I/O, setup, teardown, or debugging

---

## Async vs sync collectives

Run:

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 1_collective_communication/8_async_all_reduce_demo.py
```

Expected result:

- the script runs one synchronous `all_reduce`, then one `all_reduce(async_op=True)`
- both phases also run a fake local function that takes longer on rank `0`
- rank `0` prints a per-rank timing summary for both phases

What to notice:

- in sync mode, the local work starts only after `all_reduce` returns
- in async mode, `all_reduce(..., async_op=True)` returns a `Work` handle immediately, so each rank can do independent local work before `wait()`



---

## Contract of collectives

All participating ranks in the group must:

- call the same collective
- call those collectives in the same order
- use compatible tensor shapes
- use compatible tensor dtypes
- agree on details such as the source rank, destination rank, or list length when the API requires it

If one rank does something different, the others can block forever.

## Exercises

1. Explore point-to-point antipatterns and failure modes.
   Start from `2_send_recv_demo.py`, then try variants such as rank `0` doing `send` while rank `1` does `irecv`.
   Observe which versions complete, which versions need an explicit `wait()`, and which versions hang because the ranks no longer agree on the communication contract.

2. Explore async communication and unsafe mid-flight tensor access.
   Write a tiny `isend` / `irecv` demo, then intentionally read or overwrite the tensor before `wait()` completes.
   Record what behavior is still well-defined and what behavior becomes unsafe once the transfer is still in flight.

3. Explore shape and dtype mismatch.
   Make one rank send a tensor whose shape or dtype does not match the receive buffer, then write down what error or failure mode you see.
